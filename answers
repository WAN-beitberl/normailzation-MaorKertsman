1. The id and customerId should be primary key, because we want each combination to be uniq, with no duplicates. Also we would want to organize the purcheses in a different table that contains the customerID and the purchese

2. There can be two id's with the same customerId

3. CREATE TABLE (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, customerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
   CREATE TABLE (customerID INTEGER, purchese TEXT);

4. The table comprimize uniq keys and organization of different purcheses
