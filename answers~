1. The id should be primary key, because we want each combination to be uniq, with no duplicates. Also we would want to organize the purcheses in a different table that contains the customerID and the purchese

2. There can be two id's that are the same

3. CREATE TABLE (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, customerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
   CREATE TABLE (id INTEGER, purchese TEXT);

4. The table comprimize uniq keys and organization of different purcheses
